          "problemText": "The eight-pointed star, shown in the figure below, is a popular quilting pattern. What percent of the entire  grid is covered by the star?\nEach of the unshaded triangles has base length  and height , so they all have area . Each of the unshaded unit squares has area . The area of the shaded region is equal to the area of the entire grid minus the area of the unshaded region, or . The star is then , or  percent of the entire grid.\n~cxsmi\nThere are  total squares in the diagram and each square has  triangles whose areas are half the area of a unit square. Thus, the total number of triangles in the diagram is  triangles. There are  shaded triangles in the diagram, so the area of the star is , or  percent.\n~Pi_in_da_box\nThere are  squares that are entirely shaded and  squares that have no shading. This cancels them out. The rest of the squares are half-half. Therefore the shaded region is  percent of the grid.\nNote that we can move one triangle from each of the four cells in the middle to each of the four corners. This will leave every cell in the grid with one triangle each, and each triangle has an area of half the area of each cell. Thus, our answer must equal to , and so our answer is \n~derekwang2048\nThe shaded area is a  square in the middle of the figure combined with  small triangles. Since each small triangle is  of a unit square, the star's area is equal to the area of  unit squares, which  percent of the grid.\nYou can move the extra half a squares and make 4 squares so there are 8/16. The answer is  percent of 16.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGEGn7U4uHk\n~ ChillThingz :)\nhttps://youtu.be/dZkFuq0DZyk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTTcscvcQmI\n~hsnacademy\n~Thesmartgreekmathdude\nhttps://youtu.be/PKMpTS6b988\nhttps://youtu.be/SNviHnUR3x4\nhttps://youtu.be/Iv_a3Rz725w?si=E0SI_h1XT8msWgkK\nhttps://youtu.be/Yc4KSp0aOco\nhttps://youtu.be/fdG7EDW_7xk\nThese problems are copyrighted © by the Mathematical Association of America, as part of the American Mathematics Competitions.",
